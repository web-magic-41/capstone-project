<h1>Buyer Persona</h1>
<p><strong>Name: </strong>Marty Bonacci</p>
<p><strong>Technology: </strong>iPhone 12 with most up to date iOS and a PC running Linux </p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>Marty is a teacher at the community college, CNM, in Albuquerque, NM. He is a casual Magic enjoyer, with a mid-sized collection of Magic cards from recent years. He hates online shopping, and is averse to ordering cards from the Internet as he feels you can’t really trust the condition of a card without seeing it in person. He would be accessing a site like Burque MTG Finder because he would want to facilitate local trades and sales with other people who are located in Albuquerque and are willing to make a deal through the app, and eventually do the swap in-person.
</p>
<p><strong>Frustrations: </strong>Marty is frustrated with trying to buy cards online when he can’t find them at his local game stores. When he tries to buy off sites like TCGPlayer or Cardkingdom, while he is able to get good prices for them it is often done sight-unseen and he has no idea the condition of the card until it arrives. He wants to be able to see images of the exact card he is getting, and maybe even see it in person before committing to the sale/trade.
</p>
<p>Local game stores allow him to see the exact card he plans to buy, which he likes. However, most local game stores don’t always carry the super high end cards, or the cheaper bulk cards, and oftentimes it is easier to get those cards from online sellers or in trades with people with private collections. Marty also has his own collection of cards, not all of which he uses, that he wouldn’t mind rehoming in exchange for cards he could use or their cash value.
</p>
<p>While he can sometimes find what he wants by trading with other local players that he meets at game stores in town, Marty hates having to flip through binder after binder and pick out what he is looking for. He wishes there was an easier way to find exactly who has what he wants.
</p>
<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Marty’s goal is to be able to buy cards he needs or trade for cards he needs with people in his local area, without having to dig through bulk or collections for hours. His other goal is to be able to see and examine exactly what he is buying/trading for before he makes the transaction. </p>
<p><strong>User Story: </strong>As a buyer on Burque MTG Finder, I want to be able to find and trade for exactly what I am looking for without extra hassle. </p>
